In the actions folder there are many tests.

SkypeAutomation test has all the functinalities and features in one test. It contains multiple actions.
This test can be used to test all functionalities at once.

All other tests are for one single functionality. It means that they can be used to test one single functionality.

If you want to test each business functionality separately you can run the individual tests.

To run these test scripts on your machine:
You need to change the path of external excel files and also change the path of constants file in all the tests and actions.
Also change the file paths in excel file column for image upload.

The locator folder contains a file constants.txt which contains all the constants used in the scripts.

The recovery Scenario folder contains a recovery scenario for invalidusername.

The repository folder is empty becuase we have used only descriptive programming for creating scripts.

The result folder contains the successful run results of all the tests respectively.

The test data folder contains the excel files from which we are giving input data to our scripts.
